# Proof of Stake validator
CABS / RBS staking proof of stake. Coin age and random selection algorithm together to avoid selecting same validator with most stake everytime and giving everyone fair chance. That means, if user A has 10% ZeCash and user B has 20% ZeCash than we create a array of 30 entries and randomly select one user for minting next block.
